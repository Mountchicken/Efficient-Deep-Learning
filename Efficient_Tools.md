## 1. Torchinfo: Visualize Network Architecture

- If there is something you can fall in love with at first sight, then [torchinfo](https://github.com/TylerYep/torchinfo) must be one of them!
- [Torchinfo]((https://github.com/TylerYep/torchinfo)) provides information complementary to what is provided by print(your_model) in PyTorch, similar to Tensorflow's model.summary() API to view the visualization of the model, which is helpful while debugging your network.

## 2. drawio: Free graphing software

- `website`: [https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-desktop](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-desktop)
- drwaio is a diagramming and whiteboarding desktop app based on Electron that wraps the core draw.io editor.

## 3. Octotree: Free gitHub code tree

- [Octotree](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/octotree-github-code-tree/bkhaagjahfmjljalopjnoealnfndnagc) is a powerful and free plugin for displaying Github project code in a tree format that can drastically improve your github experience. If you're as heavily addicted to github as I am, then you can't miss it.

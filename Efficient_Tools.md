## 1. Torchinfo: Visualize Network Architecture

- **Website**:[https://github.com/TylerYep/torchinfo](https://github.com/TylerYep/torchinfo)
- If there is something you can fall in love with at first sight, then [torchinfo](https://github.com/TylerYep/torchinfo) must be one of them!
- [Torchinfo](https://github.com/TylerYep/torchinfo) provides information complementary to what is provided by print(your_model) in PyTorch, similar to Tensorflow's model.summary() API to view the visualization of the model, which is helpful while debugging your network.

- GitHub Copilot is powered by the OpenAI. Copilot is a modified, production version of the Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3), a language model using deep-learning to produce human-like text.
- For example, when provided with a programming problem in natural language, copilot is capable of generating solution code. It is also able to describe input code in English and translate code between programming languages.
- Copilot’s OpenAI is trained on a selection of the English language, public GitHub repositories, and other publicly available source code. This includes a filtered dataset of 159 gigabytes of Python code sourced from 54 million public GitHub repositories.
- Here are some examples of what copilot can do:
  * Generate a solution to a programming problem
  * Describe a code snippet in English
  * Translate code between programming languages

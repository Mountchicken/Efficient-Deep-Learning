## 1. Torchinfo: Visualize Network Architecture

- **Website**:[https://github.com/TylerYep/torchinfo](https://github.com/TylerYep/torchinfo)
- If there is something you can fall in love with at first sight, then [torchinfo](https://github.com/TylerYep/torchinfo) must be one of them!
- [Torchinfo](https://github.com/TylerYep/torchinfo) provides information complementary to what is provided by print(your_model) in PyTorch, similar to Tensorflow's model.summary() API to view the visualization of the model, which is helpful while debugging your network.

## 4. ACRONYMIFY: Name your paper with a cool acronyms

- **Website**:[http://acronymify.com/](http://acronymify.com/)
- A good paper naming not only motivates the reader to read, but also makes your paper memorable, for example by using abbreviations of words to construct an interesting word. A typical example is the Sesame Street Family in NLP (BERT, ELMO, ERNIE ...). [Acronymify](http://acronymify.com/search?q=Efficient+Deep+Learning) can automatically generate a series of acronyms for the title of your paper, and you pick the one you like

## 5. Linggle: Grammer checker
- **Website**: [https://linggle.com/](https://linggle.com/)
- When you are writing in English, have you ever encountered these similar problems:
  * `in the afternoon`, `at the afternoon`, which one is correct?
  * The preposition after `present a method` is `for` or `to`.
  * What can be the verb before `war`?
  * What nouns can be used after `execute`
  * I just made up an expression `avoid his coming`, trying to determine if it was authentic.
- Let's see how linggle can help you with it
#### 1. Search for the correct preposition pairing

- **Use / to space out the prepositions**:

</div>

<div align=center>
  <img src='images/linggle2.JPG' width=500 >
</div>

- Linggle can look up the usage of relevant prepositions in its corpus and tell you which ones are most commonly used, and will give you many examples

#### 2. What can be the verb before `war`?
- **We can use `v. a war` to query.**, `v. a war` means verb ahead war.

#### 3. What nouns can be used after `execute`?
- **`excute n.`**

<div align=center>

</div>

#### 4. Check the usage for authenticity

<div align=center>
  <img src='images/linggle6.JPG' width=500 >
</div>

- Saddly, `avoid his coming` is not authentic.

- **Linggle can do much more than those, and you can see more usages on its website.**

## 1. Torchinfo: Visualize Network Architecture

- **Website**:[https://github.com/TylerYep/torchinfo](https://github.com/TylerYep/torchinfo)
- If there is something you can fall in love with at first sight, then [torchinfo](https://github.com/TylerYep/torchinfo) must be one of them!
- [Torchinfo](https://github.com/TylerYep/torchinfo) provides information complementary to what is provided by print(your_model) in PyTorch, similar to Tensorflow's model.summary() API to view the visualization of the model, which is helpful while debugging your network.

## 3. Octotree: Free gitHub code tree

- **Website**:[https://www.octotree.io/](https://www.octotree.io/)
- [Octotree](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/octotree-github-code-tree/bkhaagjahfmjljalopjnoealnfndnagc) is a powerful and free plugin for displaying Github project code in a tree format that can drastically improve your github experience. If you're as heavily addicted to github as I am, then you can't miss it.

## 4. ACRONYMIFY: Name your paper with a cool acronyms

- **Website**:[http://acronymify.com/](http://acronymify.com/)
- A good paper naming not only motivates the reader to read, but also makes your paper memorable, for example by using abbreviations of words to construct an interesting word. A typical example is the Sesame Street Family in NLP (BERT, ELMO, ERNIE ...). [Acronymify](http://acronymify.com/search?q=Efficient+Deep+Learning) can automatically generate a series of acronyms for the title of your paper, and you pick the one you like

## 5. Linggle: Grammer checker
- **Website**: [https://linggle.com/](https://linggle.com/)
- When you are writing in English, have you ever encountered these similar problems:
  * `in the afternoon`, `at the afternoon`, which one is correct?
  * The preposition after `present a method` is `for` or `to`.
  * What can be the verb before `war`?
  * What nouns can be used after `execute`
  * I just made up an expression `avoid his coming`, trying to determine if it was authentic.
- Let's see how linggle can help you with it
#### Search for the correct preposition pairing

- **Use / to space out the prepositions**:

</div>

<div align=center>
  <img src='images/linggle2.JPG' width=500 >
</div>

- Linggle can look up the usage of relevant prepositions in its corpus and tell you which ones are most commonly used, and will give you many examples

#### What can be the verb before `war`?
- **We can use `v. a war` to query.**, `v. a war` means verb ahead war.

<div align=center>
  <img src='images/linggle4.JPG' width=500 >
</div>

#### What nouns can be used after `execute`?
- **`excute n.`**

<div align=center>
  <img src='images/linggle5.JPG' width=500 >
</div>

#### Check the usage for authenticity

<div align=center>

</div>

- Saddly, `avoid his coming` is not authentic.

- **Linggle can do much more than those, and you can see more usages on its website.**

</div>

- GitHub Copilot is powered by the OpenAI. Copilot is a modified, production version of the Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3), a language model using deep-learning to produce human-like text.
- For example, when provided with a programming problem in natural language, copilot is capable of generating solution code. It is also able to describe input code in English and translate code between programming languages.
- Copilot’s OpenAI is trained on a selection of the English language, public GitHub repositories, and other publicly available source code. This includes a filtered dataset of 159 gigabytes of Python code sourced from 54 million public GitHub repositories.
- Here are some examples of what copilot can do:
  * Generate a solution to a programming problem
  * Describe a code snippet in English
  * Translate code between programming languages
